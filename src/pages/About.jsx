            <p>
                I'm an aspiring Software Developer from Anoka, Minnesota.
                I'm currently studying Computer Application Development at Minnesota State University
                in Mankato, MN, and I'm currently looking for opportunities to gain development experience.
                I have worked with a variety of coding languages including C#, C++, JavaScript, and Java. I have some
                basic experience with Python, and I have used JavaScript mostly using React and React Native frameworks.
                I also have some experience in working with SQL Database Systems and with Linux-based server systems,
                most recently using VPS servers being hosted by both Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Service.
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm currently most familiar with the C# and JavaScript programming languages as those are the languages
                that I've used the most throughout my classes, but I'm always open to learning new technologies and methods
                if needed. I'm also somewhat familiar with Linux environments and have used them for various class projects.
